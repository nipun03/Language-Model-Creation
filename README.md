# Language-Model-Creation
In this exercise, we will train probabilistic language models to distinguish between words in different languages. Rather than looking up whole words in a dictionary, we will build models of character sequences so that we can make a guess about the language of unseen words. We will need to use NLTK and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights corpus. We will compare across different languages from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights documents. We will build unigram, bigram, and trigram character models for languages.

#### Execution
To execute the program, run following command in the command prompt py Ngram_models.py > ouptput.txt <br>
This command will save the output of program in a file "output.txt". The file will contain calculated probabilities of words of
- English Dataset with English Language Model
- French Dataset with English Language Model
- Italian Dataset with Italian Language Model
- Spanish Dataset with Italian Language Model
